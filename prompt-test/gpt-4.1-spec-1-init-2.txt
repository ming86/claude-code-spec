To begin the specification for a "user login form" (spec-1-init), you should start by generating the requirements using the user story template. Here’s how you can structure the initial requirements for a user login form, following the provided instructions:

Requirement 1: User Login
User Story: As a registered user, I want to log in with my credentials, so that I can access my account and data.

Acceptance Criteria
WHEN user provides correct email and password THEN login succeeds and user is redirected to dashboard
WHEN user provides incorrect credentials THEN system shows "Invalid credentials" error
WHEN user exceeds 5 failed attempts THEN account is temporarily locked for 15 minutes
IF user forgot password THEN system provides password reset option
Would you like to proceed with the next step (design or tasks), or do you want to refine/add more requirements for the login form?

Created requirements.md

The initial requirements for the user login form have been created at requirements.md following the user story template. There is a minor lint warning: the first line should be a top-level heading (#), not ###. Would you like me to fix this formatting issue, or proceed to the next step (design or tasks) in the spec workflow?

yes

requirements.md+2-1
The heading is now a top-level heading, resolving the previous lint error. However, there is a new warning: the "Acceptance Criteria" heading should be ## (h2) instead of #### (h4) for proper heading increment. Would you like me to fix this as well?

User: 
yes

Copilot gpt-4.1:
requirements.md+1-1
The heading levels have been corrected. The requirements file for the user login form now follows proper Markdown structure and linting rules. If you'd like to proceed to the design or task breakdown step, let me know!

User:

Copilot gpt-4.1:
Created design.md

The technical design for the user login form has been created at design.md, following the required template. If you'd like to proceed to the implementation task breakdown or need any adjustments to the design, let me know!

User:

Copilot gpt-4.1:
Created tasks.md

The implementation task breakdown for the user login form has been created at tasks.md, following the required template. The requirements, design, and tasks are now all set up for this feature. If you need to proceed further or want to review or adjust any part, just let me know!

User:

Copilot gpt-4.1:
The user login form specification is now fully initialized with requirements, design, and implementation tasks, all following the correct templates and structure. You can now begin implementation or use these documents for review, planning, or handoff.

If you need to start the next phase, generate code, or automate any part of the implementation, let me know how you'd like to proceed!
