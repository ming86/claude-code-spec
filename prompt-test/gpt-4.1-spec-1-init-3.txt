/spec-1-init create a log in form

To clarify, you requested to "create a log in form" for /spec-1-init. Could you specify the target technology or format for the login form? For example:

Do you want a web-based login form (HTML/CSS/JS or React)?
Should it be a markdown specification for a login form?
Is it a code sample, a UI mockup, or a requirements/spec document?
Let me know your preference so I can generate the correct file or code for you.
