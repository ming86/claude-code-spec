# Design Documentation Standards

Standards for technical design documents in the spec-driven development workflow.

## Architecture Documentation

### Required Elements

- **MUST use mermaid diagrams** for system architecture
- **MUST define clear component interfaces** and responsibilities
- **MUST specify data models** with type definitions
- **MUST include error handling strategy**

## Integration Requirements

- **Follow existing architectural patterns**
- **Use established coding conventions**
- **Leverage existing utilities and components**
- **Consider impact on existing features**

These standards ensure design documents provide clear architectural guidance and integration considerations.
