# Kiro Steering Document Management Workflow

## Methodology Reinforcement

You are executing Kiro Steering Document Management: intelligent project guidance system with the following approach:

- **Customization Preservation**: Never overwrite existing user content - preservation is the highest priority
- **Three-Document System**: Manage product.md, tech.md, structure.md as integrated guidance system
- **Context-Driven Generation**: Create project-specific guidance rather than generic best practices
- **Quality Enhancement**: Only add missing sections or improve incomplete areas while maintaining user intent
- **Cross-Workflow Integration**: Ensure steering documents enhance all Kiro workflow stages measurably
- **5-Dimension Validation**: Structure, content, integration, preservation, usefulness assessment

## Project Structure Validation and Analysis

## Step 1: Systematic Project Structure Analysis

**Before proceeding, think step by step about:**

1. What is the current .kiro directory structure and does it exist?
2. What existing steering documents are present and what is their current state?
3. What project structure setup is needed for optimal Kiro workflow integration?

**Project Structure Analysis Process:**

**Analyzing current project structure and steering setup systematically:**

First, I'll examine your current Kiro project structure and existing steering documents to determine the optimal approach for enhancement or creation.

**Directory Structure Validation:**

- Check if .kiro/ directory exists and create if missing
- Check if .kiro/steering/ directory exists and create if missing
- Validate proper directory organization for workflow command compatibility

**Use terminal tool to analyze directory structure:**

- Execute directory analysis commands to understand current setup
- Create necessary directories if missing for proper Kiro structure
- Validate directory permissions and accessibility

**Existing Steering Document Analysis:**

- Check for .kiro/steering/product.md existence and accessibility
- Check for .kiro/steering/tech.md existence and accessibility
- Check for .kiro/steering/structure.md existence and accessibility

**Use codebase tool to analyze existing documents if present:**

- Read complete content of each existing steering document
- Assess content quality and completeness for enhancement strategy planning
- Identify preservation requirements and enhancement opportunities

## Step 2: Existing Steering Analysis and Strategy Planning

**After analyzing the project structure, systematically determine the optimal enhancement strategy:**

**Think through the enhancement approach:**

1. What existing content should be preserved exactly?
2. What areas need enhancement or completion?
3. What strategy maintains user intent while improving quality?

**Steering Document Analysis Results:**

### Current Steering Status Assessment

**Core Documents Assessment:**

- **product.md**: [Status based on file detection - EXISTS/MISSING with quality analysis if exists]
- **tech.md**: [Status based on file detection - EXISTS/MISSING with quality analysis if exists]
- **structure.md**: [Status based on file detection - EXISTS/MISSING with quality analysis if exists]

### Enhancement Strategy Planning

**If existing documents found:**

**Existing Content Analysis:**
I've detected existing steering documents. Let me analyze their quality and completeness to determine the best approach.

**Content Quality Assessment:**
Based on the existing documents, here's my analysis:

- **product.md**: [Quality assessment - complete/partial/needs enhancement with specific areas identified]
- **tech.md**: [Quality assessment - complete/partial/needs enhancement with specific areas identified]
- **structure.md**: [Quality assessment - complete/partial/needs enhancement with specific areas identified]

**Recommended Strategy:**

- **Documents to enhance**: [List documents needing improvement with specific reasoning]
- **Documents to preserve**: [List high-quality documents to maintain exactly as-is]
- **Documents to create**: [List missing documents requiring creation]

**Customization Preservation Approach:**

- **Never overwrite**: Existing user content will be preserved exactly without modification
- **Section enhancement**: Only add missing sections or improve incomplete ones
- **User approval required**: All changes require your explicit approval before implementation
- **Quality improvement**: Enhance quality while maintaining your intent and decisions

**If no existing documents found:**

**Fresh Steering Setup:**
No existing steering documents found. I'll create a complete set of project guidance documents tailored to your specific project needs.

**What steering provides:**

- **Enhanced workflow quality**: Better requirements, design, and implementation outputs
- **Project consistency**: Standardized approaches across all features and development work
- **Context preservation**: Project knowledge persists across development sessions and team members
- **Team alignment**: Shared understanding of project goals, standards, and constraints

# Steering Context Gathering Process

## Project Context Collection for Intelligent Templates

**Before requesting context, think about what information enables genuine project-specific guidance:**

1. What product context drives better requirements and feature decisions?
2. What technology context guides better design and implementation choices?
3. What structure context enables consistent code organization and quality?

**Project Context Collection Strategy:**

To create genuinely useful steering documents, I need to understand your project context. This context will be used to customize the steering templates to your specific needs rather than generating generic guidance.

**Project Description Analysis:**
[If project description provided as argument, analyze and incorporate]
[If no argument provided, explain that project structure analysis will provide context]

**Context Gathering Areas:**

Please share information in any or all of these areas (as much or as little as you'd like):

### Product Context

- **What you're building**: Core product/application description and primary purpose
- **Target users**: Who will use this and how they will interact with your product
- **Key features**: Main capabilities and functionality that define your product value
- **Value proposition**: Why users choose your product and what problems it solves
- **Success metrics**: How you measure project success and feature effectiveness

### Technology Context

- **Current tech stack**: Languages, frameworks, tools you're using or planning to use
- **Architecture preferences**: Patterns you prefer (microservices, monolith, serverless, etc.)
- **Development environment**: Tools, IDEs, build systems, and development setup standards
- **Technical constraints**: Performance, security, compliance requirements that guide decisions
- **Integration requirements**: External systems, APIs, databases that need consideration

### Structure Context

- **Code organization**: How you prefer to organize files, modules, and components
- **Naming conventions**: Standards for files, functions, classes, variables, and modules
- **Quality standards**: Testing approaches, code style preferences, and quality criteria
- **Team practices**: Development workflows, collaboration patterns, and team standards

### Additional Guidance

- **Specific challenges**: Areas where you want better consistency or improved decision-making
- **Domain-specific needs**: Industry standards, regulatory requirements, or specialized concerns
- **Project goals**: Timeline, scope, quality priorities that should influence guidance

**Context Accumulation Strategy:**

- You can share context in one message or multiple messages as convenient
- I'll accumulate all project information before moving to scope planning
- No follow-up questions during accumulation - provide complete context as you prefer

**When ready for steering document generation, say 'proceed' or 'generate steering'**

**Wait for user context inputs until they say to proceed**

# Steering Scope Planning Process

## Systematic Scope Planning for Project-Specific Guidance

**After gathering user context, analyze all provided information to identify guidance boundaries:**

**Before presenting scope plan, think through:**

1. What guidance areas should be emphasized based on user context?
2. What project-specific focus areas need prioritization?
3. What boundaries ensure practical rather than generic guidance?

**Present Comprehensive Scope Plan:**

Based on your context, here's my approach to creating/enhancing your steering documents:

### Product Guidance Scope

**Product Guidance Will Include:**

- [Product context from user input] - Clear project vision and user focus for requirements decisions
- [Key features mentioned] - Feature development prioritization guidance for scope decisions
- [Success metrics discussed] - Quality validation criteria for feature completeness assessment
- [Value proposition elements] - User benefit focus for requirements and design alignment

### Technology Guidance Scope

**Technology Guidance Will Include:**

- [Tech stack preferences] - Development constraint guidance for architecture decisions
- [Architecture preferences] - System design decision framework for consistent choices
- [Integration requirements] - External system connection standards and API approaches
- [Technical constraints mentioned] - Performance, security, compliance guidance for design validation

### Structure Guidance Scope

**Structure Guidance Will Include:**

- [Code organization preferences] - File and module organization patterns for implementation consistency
- [Quality standards mentioned] - Code quality and testing approaches for task execution
- [Team practices discussed] - Collaboration and workflow standards for development coordination
- [Naming conventions specified] - Consistency standards for implementation decisions

### Guidance NOT Included (Reasoning-Based Boundaries)

**Project Focus Boundaries:**

- [Unmentioned technologies] - No assumptions about unused tech stacks to avoid irrelevant guidance
- [Speculative requirements] - Only guidance based on your actual context to maintain practical utility
- [Generic best practices] - Only patterns relevant to your specific project to avoid overwhelming guidance
- [Theoretical concerns] - Focus on actual project needs rather than hypothetical scenarios

**Why These Boundaries Matter:**

**Project-Specific Focus**: Guidance tailored to your actual needs enables immediate applicability rather than requiring filtering through irrelevant information.

**Practical Orientation**: Standards that enhance rather than burden development enable adoption and consistent use throughout development workflow.

**Contextual Relevance**: Only include guidance that applies to your project prevents cognitive overload and enables focused decision-making.

**Resource Efficiency**: Focused guidance allows concentrated effort on areas that actually matter for your project success rather than spreading across irrelevant concerns.

**Does this scope-focused approach align with your needs?**

**Your options:**

- **Scope looks right**: Say 'proceed' to generate steering with these boundaries
- **Adjust focus**: Tell me what to emphasize or de-emphasize in the guidance areas
- **Add context**: Share additional information for better template customization
- **Modify boundaries**: Adjust what should be included or excluded from guidance scope

**What's your feedback on this steering approach?**

**Wait for user alignment before proceeding to steering document generation**
