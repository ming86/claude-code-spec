# Feature Description Collection and Analysis

## Feature Description Input Process

**Before collecting user input, think step by step about:**

1. What examples would help users provide clear feature descriptions?
2. How can I guide users toward descriptions that enable optimal name generation?
3. What clarification questions might be needed for ambiguous descriptions?

**Feature Description Collection:**

**Please provide a description of the feature you want to develop:**

**Clear Description Examples:**

- "User authentication system" → Generates: `user-auth`
- "Payment processing dashboard" → Generates: `payment-processing`
- "Real-time chat messaging" → Generates: `real-time-chat`
- "File upload service" → Generates: `file-uploads`
- "Customer relationship management" → Generates: `crm`

**Description Quality Guidelines:**

- Include the core domain or functionality area (auth, payment, chat, file, etc.)
- Mention primary actions or behaviors (upload, process, manage, track, etc.)
- Specify system component type if relevant (service, dashboard, system, API, etc.)
- Provide enough context for meaningful name generation without excessive detail

**What feature would you like to create?**

**If description is unclear or missing, ask specific clarification questions:**

- "What is the primary domain or area this feature addresses?"
- "What are the main actions users will take with this feature?"
- "Is this primarily a service, dashboard, system, or other component type?"

**Wait for clear feature description before proceeding with name generation**

# Systematic Name Generation Algorithm

## Feature Description Analysis Framework

**After receiving feature description, systematically analyze for optimal name generation:**

**Before generating names, think step by step about:**

1. What are the 2-3 most important concepts in this description?
2. How should these concepts be prioritized for maximum naming clarity?
3. What combinations would be most memorable and typing-friendly?

**Feature Description Analysis:** "[User's feature description]"

## Step 1: Core Concept Extraction

**Systematic Concept Identification Process:**

**Primary Domain Identification:**

- Analyze description for core functionality area (authentication, payment, messaging, file management, etc.)
- Extract primary business domain or technical category
- Identify the main system area this feature addresses

**Action/Behavior Analysis:**

- Identify key verbs and functional behaviors mentioned (upload, process, manage, track, analyze, etc.)
- Extract primary actions users will perform with this feature
- Determine core behavioral patterns and workflows

**Component Type Assessment:**

- Determine system component type (service, dashboard, system, API, interface, etc.)
- Assess architectural role and integration patterns
- Identify technical classification for context

**Concept Extraction Results:**

- **Primary Domain**: [Core functionality area identified]
- **Key Actions**: [Primary verbs and behaviors extracted]
- **Component Type**: [System classification determined]

## Step 2: Concept Prioritization Strategy

**Systematic Prioritization Framework:**

**Priority Assessment Process:**
Think through concept importance for naming effectiveness:

**Primary Concept (Highest Priority):**

- **Selected**: [Most important concept for name recognition]
- **Reasoning**: [Why this concept is most critical for feature identification]

**Secondary Concept (Supporting Priority):**

- **Selected**: [Supporting concept that adds clarity without redundancy]
- **Reasoning**: [How this concept enhances name specificity and usability]

**Tertiary Concept (Optional Clarity):**

- **Selected**: [Additional concept only if adds significant clarity]
- **Reasoning**: [Whether this concept improves understanding without excessive length]

**Prioritization Results:**

- **Core Focus**: [Primary concept for name foundation]
- **Supporting Elements**: [Secondary concepts for name enhancement]
- **Clarity Additions**: [Tertiary concepts if needed for disambiguation]

## Step 3: Name Generation Candidates

**Multi-Candidate Generation Process:**

**Systematic Candidate Creation:**

**Before generating candidates, plan combination strategies:**

1. Which concept combinations create the clearest feature identification?
2. How can I balance comprehensiveness with brevity for optimal usability?
3. What combinations best follow established project patterns?

**Candidate Generation Results:**

**Candidate 1: [Domain-Action Approach]**

- **Name**: `[primary-domain]-[key-action]`
- **Character Count**: [X characters]
- **Reasoning**: [Why this combination effectively represents the feature]
- **Clarity Assessment**: [How well it indicates functionality at first glance]
- **Typing Ease**: [Assessment of memorability and ease of typing]

**Candidate 2: [Domain-Type Approach]**

- **Name**: `[primary-domain]-[component-type]`
- **Character Count**: [X characters]
- **Reasoning**: [Why this combination provides effective feature identification]
- **Clarity Assessment**: [How well it communicates purpose and scope]
- **Typing Ease**: [Assessment of user-friendliness and recall]

**Candidate 3: [Action-Type Approach]** (if distinct from domain)

- **Name**: `[key-action]-[component-type]`
- **Character Count**: [X characters]
- **Reasoning**: [Why this combination offers unique identification value]
- **Clarity Assessment**: [How effectively it conveys functionality]
- **Typing Ease**: [Assessment of practical usability and consistency]

## Step 4: Final Selection and Validation

**Comprehensive Selection Analysis:**

**Before making final selection, systematically evaluate candidates:**

1. Which candidate provides the clearest indication of feature functionality?
2. Which candidate best balances brevity with comprehensiveness?
3. Which candidate follows established project naming patterns most effectively?

**Evaluation Criteria Application:**

**Clarity Assessment:**

- **Winner**: [Candidate with clearest functionality indication]
- **Analysis**: [Specific reasons why this candidate excels in clarity]

**Brevity Evaluation:**

- **Character Efficiency**: [Candidate with optimal length-to-information ratio]
- **Typing Assessment**: [Which candidate is most user-friendly for repeated typing]

**Memorability Analysis:**

- **Recognition Factor**: [Which candidate is most memorable and distinctive]
- **Pattern Consistency**: [Which candidate best follows established naming conventions]

**Pattern Compliance Validation:**

- **Kebab-Case Check**: All candidates must match ^[a-z0-9-]+$ pattern
- **Character Limit**: Preference for under 25 characters when possible
- **Special Characters**: Ensure no invalid characters or formatting issues

**Final Selection Decision:**
**Selected Name**: `[optimal-candidate-name]`

**Selection Reasoning:**
Based on systematic evaluation across all criteria, this name was chosen because:

- **Functionality Clarity**: [Specific clarity advantages]
- **Usability Excellence**: [Specific usability benefits]
- **Pattern Compliance**: [Confirmation of all requirement satisfaction]
- **Project Integration**: [How it fits with existing naming patterns]

## Name Availability Validation and Conflict Resolution

**Systematic Conflict Detection Process:**

**Before checking availability, plan conflict resolution approach:**

1. Does the selected name already exist in the project structure?
2. If conflicts exist, what suffix strategy provides the best alternative?
3. How can I maintain name quality while resolving availability issues?

**Availability Check Execution:**
Use terminal tool to check .kiro/specs/ directory for existing features

**Conflict Resolution Strategy:**

**If name is available:**

- **Final Name Confirmed**: `[selected-name]`
- **Status**: Available and ready for project structure setup

**If naming conflict detected:**

**Systematic Suffix Generation:**

- **Primary Alternative**: `[selected-name]-v2` (for version-based distinction)
- **Secondary Alternative**: `[selected-name]-alt` (for alternative approach distinction)
- **Additional Alternatives**: `[selected-name]-v3`, `[descriptive-alternative]` if multiple conflicts

**Conflict Resolution Communication:**

- **Original Conflict**: `[conflicting-name]` already exists in project structure
- **Resolution Applied**: Generated `[alternative-name]` using systematic suffix approach
- **Quality Maintained**: Alternative preserves clarity and usability of original selection
- **Transparency**: Clear explanation of conflict detection and resolution process

**Final Name Determination:**
**Project Feature Name**: `[final-selected-name]`
**Naming Process**: Systematic algorithm applied with [conflict resolution details if applicable]

# Project Structure Assessment and Setup

## Comprehensive Project Structure Validation

**Before proceeding with structure setup, systematically assess current project state:**

**Project Structure Analysis Process:**

1. What existing Kiro directory structure is already in place?
2. What directories need creation for proper workflow functionality?
3. What steering documents exist and how do they impact initialization quality?

**Project Structure Assessment Execution:**

**Core Directory Validation:**
Use terminal tool to check project structure systematically

**Directory Structure Assessment:**

- **.kiro Directory**: [Check if .kiro/ exists and is accessible]
- **Specs Directory**: [Check if .kiro/specs/ exists with proper permissions]
- **Feature Directory Path**: [Validate .kiro/specs/[feature-name]/ availability]

**Steering Document Discovery:**
Use codebase tool to locate and assess steering documents

**Steering Assessment Results:**

**Core Steering Documents:**

- **product.md**: [EXISTS/MISSING - Content quality assessment if exists]
- **tech.md**: [EXISTS/MISSING - Technical guidance evaluation if exists]
- **structure.md**: [EXISTS/MISSING - Organization standards assessment if exists]

**Custom Steering Evaluation:**

- **Domain-specific guidance**: [Assessment of specialized steering documents]
- **Project standards**: [Evaluation of existing project-specific guidance]

## Steering Optimization Recommendations

**If steering documents exist:**
**Steering Status**: Detected [number] steering documents - Excellent foundation for quality workflow

**Workflow Enhancement Benefits:**

- **Project Context**: Steering provides specific project standards and constraints for better feature development
- **Technical Standards**: Technical guidance ensures consistency with established architectural patterns
- **Quality Standards**: Organization patterns improve workflow efficiency and consistency

**If minimal or no steering exists:**
**Steering Status**: Limited steering guidance detected

**Quality Enhancement Opportunity:**
Setting up steering documents significantly improves workflow quality and results:

**Recommended Steering Setup:**

- **Core Steering**: Use steering setup commands to create product.md, tech.md, structure.md
- **Enhanced Quality**: Steering provides project-specific context that creates more targeted and effective requirements
- **Consistency Benefits**: Establishes standards that improve quality across all workflow stages

**Setup Commands for Enhancement:**

- `/kiro:0-steering` - Create core steering documents (product, technical, organizational)
- `/kiro:0-steering-custom` - Add domain-specific guidance for specialized needs

**User Decision Point:**
**Options for proceeding:**

- **Continue without steering**: Proceed with generic but functional initialization
- **Setup steering first**: Enhance quality by establishing project guidance before feature initialization

**What would you like to do?**

- Say "proceed" to continue with current project state
- Say "setup steering" if you want to establish project guidance first

**Wait for user decision before continuing with feature initialization**
